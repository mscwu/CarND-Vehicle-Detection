    "\n",
    "* Prepare a good training dataset based on GTI, KITTI, CrowdAI image database.\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to HOG feature vector.\n",
    "* Normalize features and randomize a selection for training and testing\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected."

    "For a machine learning problem, it is very important to work with a good dataset from the very beginning. GTI and KITTI image databases are widely used for research and industry purposes. Additionaly, CrowdAI also provides label vehicle images gathered in the US. After observing the GTI database, I immediately found that the vehicle images are collected based on a continuous video stream therefore, even though there are over 3000 vehicle images in the database, to optimize the classifier, I only plan to use a fraction of them. After subsampling the GTI dataset, new data from CrowAI is added to balance the positive and negative samples. Details on the implementation can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/mscwu/udacity_vehicle_detection/blob/master/create_pickled_data.ipynb)."
